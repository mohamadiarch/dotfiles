" Vimscript notes {{{
" ---------------
" use | to split up two commands
" == depends on ignorecare setting (use ==#)
" functions must start with a capital (if they are unscoped)
"
" variables have various scopes:
"  g:var    - global
"  b:var    - local to buffer
"  l:var    - local to function
"  a:var    - a function arg
"  t:var    - local to tabpage

"
" At start-up Vim sources all files in plugins folders in $RUNTIMEPATH. This
" is the best place to store things that are language agnostic and only need
" to be sourced once.
"
" When a new file-type buffer is loaded Vim sources all
" ftplugin/{filetype}.vim files in $RUNTIMEPATH
"
" Put Vim files in after to ensure they get sourced AFTER all core/bundle
" version have run. This is how you OVERRIDE.

" Vim-plug and plugins {{{
" ------------------------
" Plugins managed with vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
" Available commands: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#commands
"   :PlugUpgrade - upgrade vim-plug
"   :PlugUpdate  - update plugins

call plug#begin("~/.vim/plugged")

" Editing 
" -------

" Mappings for editing surrounding delimiters, tags etc, eg
"   cs"<em>     => Change Surrounding quotes to <em> tags
"   ysiw[       => applY Surrounding brackets to word (iw) or other text object
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plug 'tpope/vim-repeat'

" Mapping for jumping between lists, eg:
"   [q  => previous quickfix location
"   ]q  => next quickfix location
"   [Q  => first quickfix location
"   ]Q  => last quickfix location
Plug 'tpope/vim-unimpaired'

" Extend % matching to include HTML tags
Plug 'tmhedberg/matchit'

" Zen-mode for editing:
" https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim
Plug 'junegunn/goyo.vim'

" Non-standard text-objects
" -------------------------
" See https://codeinthehole.com/tips/vim-text-objects/

" Provides lots of text-objects
"   Use one of , . ; : + - = ~ _ * # / for delimited strings
"   Use a for a function arg
" https://github.com/wellle/targets.vim
Plug 'wellle/targets.vim'

" Use 'i' as a text obj for an indented block
Plug 'kana/vim-textobj-indent'
Plug 'kana/vim-textobj-user'  " requirement of vim-textobj-indent and vim-textobj-line

" Use 'l' for the whole line (useful with vim-surround)
Plug 'kana/vim-textobj-line'

" Use 'e' for entire buffer
Plug 'kana/vim-textobj-entire'

" Use 'f' for function, 'c' for class
Plug 'bps/vim-textobj-python'

" Use 'c' for comment block
Plug 'glts/vim-textobj-comment'

" Custom text objects for Django templates
"   Use 'db' for block
"   Use 'df' for for loop
"   Use 'dv' for {{ var }}
"   Use 'dt' for {% tag %}
" Plus others starting with d
Plug 'mjbrownie/django-template-textobjects'

" Navigation
" ----------

" Quick file/buffer/tag searching (faster than CtrlP)
" ctrl-v - open file in split
" See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim#commands
"
"     :GFiles - git files
"     :Colors - colorschemes
"     :Lines  - lines in open buffers
"     :Commits - git commits
"     :History - buffer history
"
" Some leader-mappings defined for these below too.
Plug '/usr/local/opt/fzf'
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'

" Shows 'Match X of Y' in command bar
Plug 'henrik/vim-indexed-search'

" Syntax highlighting and indentation
" -----------------------------------

" Language pack with syntax and indent files for a range of language
Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'

" Better markdown support than that provided by vim-polyglot. Vim-polyglot
" already provides the indent and syntax parts of this plugin, but the folding
" part is useful too so we install it separately and disable markdown support from polyglot.
"
" Useful features include:
" - folding
" - highlighting of fenced code blocks
" - highlighting of front-matter
Plug 'godlygeek/tabular'
Plug 'plasticboy/vim-markdown'

" Git integration 
" ---------------

" Git(hub) integration
" :Gstatus
" :Gbrowse! - copy Github URL to clipboard
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'

" Github integration for fugitive
Plug 'tpope/vim-rhubarb'

" More sophisticated last-position opening which ignores gitcommit
Plug 'dietsche/vim-lastplace'

" Linting 
" -------

" https://github.com/w0rp/ale
Plug 'w0rp/ale'

" HTML editing
" ------------

" Another quick way of writing tags - use C-K to expand the shorthand syntax
" eg .container > .wrapper > ul > li.item * 4
Plug 'rstacruz/sparkup', {'rtp': 'vim/'}

" Color scheme
" ------------

" See http://vimcolors.com/
Plug 'jnurmine/Zenburn'

" Debugging
" ---------

" Provides a slew of useful commands like
" https://github.com/tpope/vim-scriptease
"
"   :Messages
"   :Scriptnames
"   :Verbose
"   zS - show active syntax highlight group under the cursor
Plug 'tpope/vim-scriptease'

"
" - Each group starts with autocmd! to remove all existing commands for that
"   group. This prevents each sourcing from adding duplicate autocommands
